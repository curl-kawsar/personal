                <h4 class="mtitle">User experience design (UXD)</h4>
                <p>The phrase "User experience" was first coined in the 1990s by cognitive psychologist, Don Norman. The
                  principles of UX actually stretch back thousands of years, all the way to ancient China, where the practice of
                  Feng Shui began. Practitioners believe that the arrangement of a physical space, like how furniture is
                  positioned in a room, could bring someone luck or improve their health and happiness. Today, lots of different
                  industries still rely on these same basic ideas. In tech world, UX mostly focuses on how people use or interact
                  with products. A product is a good, service, or feature. It might be a physical product (video game controller,
                  bag of photato chips, etc) or a technology product (app, website, smarthwatch, etc).
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>UX is all about how a person, the user, feels about interacting with, or experiencing, a product.</li>
                  <li>UX designers focus on the experience that users have while using products like websites, apps, and physical
                    objects.</li>
                  <li>UX designers make those everyday interactions useful, enjoyable, and accessible.</li>
                  <li>UX designers help make technology easier to understand and more enjoyable to use.</li>
                  <li>UX designers tend to be curious about people and like thinking about how people's mind work.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>UX designer focus on users. Why is it important that designs are centered on the user? Because the user buys
                  and uses your product. In addition, it's also important to solve problems that people actually experience,
                  rather than only trying to solve problems you personally experience. Focus on the user and all else will follow.
                  Focusing on the user means considering their story, emotions, and the insights you've gathered about them.</p>
                <p>UX designer is important for consumers and businesses. Why? When people like a product, they use that product a
                  lot, and they recommended it to their friends. And more people using the product means better bussiness for the
                  company. Plus, when users have a good experience with the product, they're more likely to have a positive
                  opinion ot the company that made it. A win-win for the user and the business. Can you think of a product you
                  loved so much that you shared it with a friend? If you did, that's a great example of UX design in action.
                  That's
                  why organizations of all kinds, in varied industries, need to hire UX designers. Because UX designer can play in
                  improving the business.</p>

                <p>Virtual reality involves a wearable headset that takes over a user’s vision; it blocks out their physical
                  surroundings and immerses them in a completely virtual world. For example, VR can feel like you're entering the
                  setting of a magical imaginary land.</p>
                <p>Augmented reality uses the physical world as a backdrop and adds virtual elements on top of it. Users are still
                  contextually aware of their surroundings, but their reality is augmented, or enhanced, by adding elements
                  through a screen. For example, you can sit in your actual kitchen, and an AR experience can add digital images,
                  like a new barstool or a piece of artwork, to the room around you.</p>
                <p>Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) designers create products that provide users with immersive
                  experiences, unbounded by the limits of the physical world. To ensure users are comfortable immersing in a VR or

                  exact names of each stage might be a little different, but the overall process is generally the same. As a
                  product moves through the development life cycle, the team might need to spend longer working in one stage than
                  in others, or repeat certain stages based on feedback. The success of each stage depends on the previous stage’s
                  completion, so it’s important to do them in order.</p>

                  key role in this stage, because you're exploring different ways to get to know the audience you're designing
                  for. UX researchers and writes are often heavily involved in this stage, where the team might conduct interviews

                  you want to solve when you begin the product development life cycle. If not, coming up with a list of user
                  problems is a great place to start. It’s important to pay attention to the diversity of your team at this stage.
                  Teams that have meaningful diversity across identifiers like race, gender, abilities, family structure, age, and
                  ethnicity are generally more effective at brainstorming because they bring together a lot of different lived
                  experiences.</p>
                <p>The brainstorm stage is also an ideal time to check out your product's competitors and identify if there are
                  already similar products available in the market. You want your product to fill a gap in the market or solve a
                  problem better than existing products. Completing research into both your competitors and your users helps
                  determine what problems need to be addressed by the product’s design.</p>
                <hr><br>
                <p>Consider this example: If you’re designing a new app to help working parents and guardians, your team

                  lack of reliable childcare, transportation concerns, or trouble managing schedules. Your team might review user
                  feedback about other similar products or the results of user surveys to help guide your ideas. After you’ve
                  brainstormed lots of user problems, your team chooses one and starts coming up with ideas for solutions to

                  the team determines concrete ways that the product being developed will impact the user. As a UX designer,

                <hr><br>
                <p>During the define stage, your team narrows the focus of your idea. One product can’t solve every user problem.
                  In this stage, a UX designer might help the team pin down the focus of the idea, but a product lead will
                  probably be the one to define the scope of the project. The research you completed in the brainstorm stage comes
                  in handy now. Using what you've learned, you will pinpoint your potential users’ problems. Your team can’t
                  assume they know what problems users are experiencing without asking the users directly.</p>
                <hr><br>
                <p>Continuing with the example for an app to help working parents and guardians, your idea should focus on

                  models of a product that convey its functionality. UX writers are also involved in the design stage and might do
                  things like write button labels or other copy within the product's wireframes and prototypes. At this point in

                <hr><br>
                <p>For example, UX designers might check that the screens of an app flow in a way that makes sense to the user.
                  Or that each interaction, like tapping a button, has a correlating action, like an item getting added to a
                  cart. On the other hand, with a physical product, UX designers might check that one piece of a physical object
                  matches up to the connecting piece. UX designers also make sure that each task a user needs to complete is clear
                  and easy to understand, like navigating from the homepage to the checkout confirmation page in an app.</p>

                  reviews with stakeholders, and external tests with potential users. A stakeholder is a person you need to work
                  with to complete the project or anyone who has some interest in the project, either within or outside of the
                  company.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>First, the team tests the product internally to look for technical glitches and usability problems. This is
                    often referred to as <b>alpha testing</b>.</li>
                  <li>Then, the product undergoes a test with stakeholders to make sure the product is aligned with the company’s
                    vision, meets legal guidelines for accessibility, and follows government regulations for privacy, for example.
                  </li>
                  <li>Finally, there’s an external test with potential users. This is the time to figure out whether the product
                    provides a good user experience, meaning it’s usable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful. This is often referred
                    to as <b>beta testing</b>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Gathering and implementing feedback at this stage is absolutely critical. If users are frustrated or confused
                  by your product, UX designers make adjustments or even create new versions of the design. Then, the designs are
                  tested again, until there’s little or no friction between the product and the user. It’s important to call out
                  that the product development life cycle isn’t a completely linear process. Your team might cycle between
                  designing and testing a few times before you're ready to launch the product!</p>

                <p><b>Sharing a finished version of the product with the public.</b> This might involve listing an app in the
                  Google Play Store or Apple’s App Store, making a website go live, or putting a physical product on store
                  shelves. However, the work on a product isn't quite finished after launch. You may still identify opportunities
                  to improve on the designs or learn even more about the UX based on feedback. This could involve going back to
                  the design or testing stages and figuring out ways to produce a more enhanced version of the product.</p>
                <hr><br>
                <p>The launch stage is a time to celebrate your work and start promoting the product. Marketing professionals on
                  your team might post about the new product on social media or publish a press release. The customer support team
                  might get ready to help new users learn how the product works. Program managers also meet with the
                  cross-functional team to reflect on the entsire product development life cycle and ask questions like:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>What worked and what could be improved?</li>
                  <li>Were goals achieved?</li>
                  <li>Were timelines met?</li>
                </ul>
                <hr><br>
                <p>For a physical product, the launch stage might be the end of the product development life cycle. But for a
                  digital product, like an app or website, launching the product to a wider audience provides another opportunity
                  to improve on the user experience. New users might find problems with the product’s functionality or features to
                  improve that no one noticed before. So, after the launch stage, teams will often cycle back to the design and
                  testing stages to start working on the next version of a digital product.</p>

                <p>A generalist has a broad number of responsibilities. A majority of UX design jobs are generalist positions,
                  especially at companies with fewer UX designers. Typically, entry-level UX designers work in generalist roles,
                  and some people choose to stay in generalist design roles for their entire careers. There are a lot of benefits

                <ul>
                  <li>Expanding your skills in many different types of UX work.</li>
                  <li>Trying a variety of responsibilities and finding an area of UX that you’re especially passionate about.</li>

                <p>A specialist dives deep into one type of UX design, like interaction, visual, or motion design, and becomes an
                  expert. Specialist UX designers are more common at large companies that have a lot of designers, like here at
                  Google. Some of the benefits of becoming a specialist include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Focusing on one type of design that you enjoy more than others.</li>

                <p>A T-shaped designer is a specialist who also has a lot of capabilities in other areas. T-shaped designers get
                  their name because the stem (or vertical line) of a T represents their expertise in one area, while the top (or
                  horizontal line) symbolizes their related skills in a broad number of areas. T-shaped designers are great to
                  have on your team, since they come with the benefits of both specialists and generalists.</p>
                <p>Each designer tends to naturally have a little T-shape in their abilities, even at the beginning of their
                  career. As you start to work on projects, you’ll probably notice where your strengths and interests lie. As you
                  get better at one area of design, you’ll likely find yourself working on that part of design projects more
                  often, which helps you continue to improve in one area.</p>
                <p>The image below highlights some of the skills a T-shaped UX designer might have. In this example, the person is

                  the user takes with that product or service. As a UX designer, your goal is to keep the user at the center of

                <p>To reach as many users as possible, you’ll consider questions such as these as part of your user research
                  approach:</p>

                  <li>Do my users have impairments or disabilities to consider–whether temporary, situational, or permanent?</li>

                  <li>Have I considered all my potential users?</li>

                <p>The goal for user research is to get the widest possible selection of potential users to include as research
                  participants. Make sure to consider income level; demographic data such as age, gender, and ethnicity;
                  educational background; and geographic location. Your goal as a UX designer is to solve a user problem by
                  creating a design that makes every user feel like you designed the experience just for them no matter who they
                  are, where they live, how much they earn, what their abilities are, or how highly they're educated.</p>

                <p><b>Do my users have impairments or disabilities to consider–whether temporary, situational, or permanent?</b>
                </p>
                <p>You might be surprised to find out that more than 1 billion people around the world have a disability, out of a
                  global population of 7.8 billion. In the U.S., one in four adults identifies as having a disability. The term
                  accessibility refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities.
                  As a UX designer, it’s important to keep users with disabilities in mind as you design features or new products.
                  Designing for accessibility isn't an obstacle, but a way to get your products to as many users as possible.
                  Accessibility is about making products accessible to all people, whether they have a disability or not. Think
                  about inclusive product features that increase magnification, like enlarged fonts. Or features that help
                  everyone understand videos, like closed captions.</p>
                <p><b>How familiar are my users with technology?</b></p>
                <p>User experience doesn’t just focus on the experience of existing users, however. It also includes paying
                  attention to the needs of people who are about to become users. Nearly a billion people, of all ages, all around
                  the world, are getting online for the very first time. When it comes to designing for this emerging population
                  of potential users, their level of digital literacy is a key consideration. The American Library Association
                  defines digital literacy as “the ability to use information and communication technologies to find, evaluate,
                  create, and communicate information, requiring both cognitive and technical skills.” People with limited digital
                  literacy might not be familiar with certain design patterns, calls to action, or icons that those of us with
                  more online experience take for granted. For example, they might not know what “swipe” means in relation to a
                  touchscreen. They may not even know what a touchscreen is. This can affect their confidence and willingness to
                  explore new technology.</p>
                <p><b>How are my users accessing the product or service?</b></p>
                <p>It’s important to keep in mind that not all users will access your product or service in the same way due to
                  the cost and availability of devices and internet services. These factors are often due to other broader and
                  historical factors in the markets you might be designing for. Some users might not have reliable or unlimited
                  access to the internet. This might be because the data they have purchased has run out or because their network
                  coverage is inconsistent or sporadic. As a UX designer, you should try to find ways to take the offline
                  experience into account as well. For more examples of ways you can create a rich offline experience for your
                  users, check out the article <a href="https://web.dev/offline-ux-design-guidelines/">Offline UX design
                    guidelines</a>.</p>
                <p><b>Where are my users accessing the product or service?</b></p>
                <p>In some cases, you might be designing a product or service intended for use by people in various locations
                  around the world, which creates some additional considerations, like local languages and cultural norms. Keep in
                  mind that cultures and norms are ever-changing as people integrate and recontextualize technology in their
                  lives, so you’ll need to continue to research potential users to identify shifts in user problems, preferences,
                  and usage patterns over time. Users who speak languages other than the primary language of the product or
                  service you’re designing might want or need to switch languages on their device depending on what they’re trying
                  to accomplish. For example, a user might want to read in Hindi but type using the English keyboard. Or the user
                  might encounter a concept that cannot be easily translated from one language to another. Designing a
                  multilingual keyboard option, and using universally-recognized icons, like an icon with a local currency sign
                  for a banking app, are just a few key ways UX designers can make it easier for users in different locales.</p>

                  <li>When designers began considering how to include an even broader range of people in their designs.</li>
                  <li>The process of creating one product for users with the widest range of abilities and in the widest range of
                    situations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The problem is that when you focus on creating one solution for everyone, the design lose their effectiveness.
                  It's often difficult to achieve any goals with your product when you have so many intended users. It's like when
                  you go to a store that sells a hat in just one size, the label might read one-size-fits-all, but the hat still
                  won't fit a lot of people. Universal design had the same problem. Even though it had the intention of being
                  inclusive, it excluded a lot of people. It turns out one-size-fits-all isn't a great solution. Universal design
                  didn't meet the needs of every user.</p>

                  <li>Focuses on finding solutions to meet different needs.</li>
                  <li>Making design choices that take into account personal identifiers like ability, race, economic status,

                </ul>
                <p>Inclusive design includes researchers and designers from traditionally excluded populations in the process, so
                  they can provide their unique perspectives during all phases of the design process. With inclusive design, you
                  solve for one type of user, and the benefit of that solution can extend to many other types of users. Our goal
                  as designers is to build experiences that are accessible to users with the widest range of abilities. In other
                  word, no one should be excluded from using a product that we built because we didn't consider their needs when
                  building it. In inclusive design, there's no such thing as normal. There's no average person or target audience
                  that we should design for.</p>
                <p>For example, when designing we focus on the needs of people who are blind and deaf even more than we consider
                  the needs of those who rely on their sight and hearing to communicate. Then as we build more versions of a
                  product, we design for additional excluded groups, like those with physical or cognitive disabilities.
                  <b>Designing products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities is called
                    accessibility.</b>
                </p>
                <p>Difference helps us think creatively and helps us see gaps in our products. Often when we look into those gaps
                  and the insights that we gain from looking at people who experience the world differently, we build better
                  products that are more adaptable, that are longer-lasting, and more innovative. Types of accessibility issues:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Visual (e.g. color blindness)</li>
                  <li>Motor/mobility (e.g. wheelchair-user concerns)</li>
                  <li>Auditory (hearing difficulties)</li>
                  <li>Seizures (especially photosensitive epilepsy)</li>
                  <li>Learning/cognitive (e.g. dyslexia)</li>
                  <li>Speech</li>
                </ul>
                <p>But keep in mind that the idea of "solve for one, extend to many," only benefits the group the design was
                  created for and existing users. Many groups are still left out. Over time UX designers realized that inclusive
                  design wasn't always enough, and that's where we find ourselves today as equity-focused design becomes a new
                  industry goal.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>The goal of equity-focused design is to uplift groups that have been excluded historically. In order to design
                  with equity as a goal, we first need to know the difference between equality and equity. The two words sound
                  similar, but they're actually two different concepts. <b>Equality</b> means providing the same amount of
                  opportunity and support to all segments of society. In other words, everyone gets the same thing. <b>Equity</b>
                  means providing different levels of opportunity and support for each person in order to achieve fair outcomes.
                  To better understand the difference between equality and equity, check out this illustration.</p>
                <q-img src="../assets/ux/section-01/equality-vs-equity.png"></q-img>
                <p>The illustration on the left represents equality because every person gets the same box to stand on, but
                  because each person has a different height the tallest person has a better view. The illustration on the right
                  represents equity, because each person is given what they need. The shortest person is given the tallest stack
                  of boxes to stand on.</p>
                <p>So what does this look like in the real world? Start by identifying a product you want to build. Then, think
                  about the groups that have not been served by this type of product in the past. Finally, build your design while
                  keeping the groups who identified as underrepresented front and center. It's important to keep in mind that
                  equity-focused design doesn't solve all problems, just like inclusive design and universal design don't either.
                  The key point is that these are all different approaches to solving issues of underrepresentation and designing
                  for a more equitable future.</p>

                <p>Assistive technology (AT) is used to describe any products, equipment, and systems that enhance learning,
                  working, and daily living for people with disabilities.</p>
                <p>It's important to call out that there are lots of people who don't identify as having a disability but still
                  use assistive technologies. That's because ATs make our lives easier and help provide a better user experience.
                  When we think of assistive technology, we might think of computers, tablets, and smartphones. But AT covers a
                  wide range of devices, like prosthetics, pointing devices, electric wheelchairs, power lifts, eye gaze and head
                  trackers, and a whole lot more. AT can also encompass something as low tech as a pencil holder. Not only does a
                  pencil holder keep your pencil from rolling away, it also makes pencils easier to grip, which can be essential
                  for people with certain motor disabilities.</p>

                <p>Most UX designers follow a specific framework or process when approaching their work, from the first idea all
                  the way through to the final launch of a product. As a reminder, a framework creates the basic structure that
                  focuses and supports the problem you’re trying to solve, kind of like an outline for a project. Every designer
                  and every team is different, so it’s helpful to have a solid understanding of each framework before you start
                  designing.</p>
                <p>In this certificate program, you’ll follow the <b>Design Thinking framework</b> to sequence the assignments
                  that contribute to the designs that you’ll create throughout the program. The Design Thinking framework is a
                  user-centered approach to problem-solving that includes activities like research, prototyping, and testing to
                  help you understand who your user is, what their problems are, and what your design should include.</p>
                <p>The Design Thinking framework is only one type of framework that UX designers use to organize their approach to
                  designs, often based on the product they’re designing and the organization they’re working for. <b>No matter
                    which frameworks you use in your career, they all have a few core principles in common:</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Focus on the user.</li>

                <p>The five elements of UX design is a framework of steps that UX designers take to turn an idea into a working
                  product. The five elements are, from bottom to top: strategy, scope, structure, skeleton, and surface. Think of
                  these as a set of five layers, where each layer is dependent on the one below it.</p>

                <p>Design thinking is a user-centered approach to problem-solving. It helps designers create solutions that
                  address a real user problem and are functional and affordable. There are five phases in the design process:
                  empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test.</p>
                <q-img src="../assets/ux/section-01/framework-design-thinking.png"></q-img><br><br>
                <p>Though it may sound like a linear process, the Design Thinking framework should be iterative, which means that
                  you’ll repeat certain phases as you refine your designs. For example, depending on the feedback you receive
                  during testing, you might need to conduct additional research, brainstorm new ideas, or develop new prototypes.

                <h4 class="mtitle">Emphatize</h4>
                <p>During the empathize phase, your primary goal is to learn more about the user and their problems, wants, and
                  needs, and the environment or context in which they’ll experience your design. The most important part of the
                  empathize phase is to step away from your assumptions and guesses and let your research findings inform your
                  decision-making in later design phases.</p>
                <p>Your user research might include user surveys, interviews, and observation sessions, and you might also need to
                  conduct some research on the competitors’ products to determine how your user frames competitors’ products as
                  part of their daily life and daily problem-solving.</p>

                <p>In the define phase, you’ll analyze your research findings from the empathize phase and determine which user
                  problems are the most important ones to solve, and why. This will drive you toward a clear goal for the design
                  of the product.</p>
                <p>The most important outcome of this phase is a clear problem statement, which is a description of the user’s
                  need that your designs will address. You might also develop a value proposition, which is a summary of why your
                  user would or should use the product or service that you’re designing.</p>

                <h4 class="mtitle">Ideate</h4>
                <p>After you land on a user problem and establish why it’s an important one to solve, it’s time for the ideate
                  phase. The goal of ideation is to come up with as many design solutions as possible—don’t settle for your first
                  solution because the most obvious solution is not always the right one.</p>
                <p>Ideation involves collaborative brainstorming with other members of your team to generate as many solutions as
                  possible to a problem. This could include marketing, engineering, product management, or any other stakeholders
                  for the product or service. During brainstorming sessions, you should explore all possible solutions. Don’t
                  focus on whether something is a “good” or “bad” idea, just collect as many ideas as you can. The important thing
                  here is to keep this process judgment-free.</p>
                <p>After brainstorming, you’ll then analyze your potential solutions and start to make choices about which ones
                  are the best options to pursue as prototypes. You might return to user or competitive research to help you
                  narrow down your ideas, and you might also create user flows to illustrate how the user will interact with your
                  solution.</p>

                <p>After you have an idea of how to solve the problem, you’re ready to enter the prototype phase, where your goal
                  is to produce an early model of a product that demonstrates its functionality and can be used for testing. The
                  test phase is critical to developing the right solution to address your user’s problem, and an organized
                  approach to testing can help you create exceptional user experiences.</p>
                <p>Prototyping and testing are interconnected, which means that you’ll test your designs at each stage of
                  prototype development rather than waiting to test until after the working prototype is complete. If the design
                  is too polished the first time you present it to users, you might not get as much feedback. Think about ways to
                  include testing throughout the design process, so that you’re iterating your designs based on user feedback
                  instead of other reasons. </p>
                <p>For example, you might test the concepts behind your design by presenting users with a simple sketch,
                  wireframe, or a sitemap. Taking what you learned, you might iterate on that design to a more detailed design on
                  paper (known as a low-fidelity prototype) and conduct another round of user testing. At some point, you’ll
                  iterate the design again into a working, interactive model using a software program (also known as a
                  high-fidelity prototype) and test that as well. You might also consider testing more than one prototype at the
                  same time to get feedback on multiple solutions, or testing the same prototype on multiple platforms, such as a
                  laptop, tablet, and smartphone. </p>
                <p>The goal of testing prototypes is to continue to refine the prototype as you gain insight into whether the
                  design for your product or service is easy to use and solves the user’s problem.At some point, you’ll finalize a
                  prototype, and then you’ll provide it to developers, who will then turn your design into a product.</p>

                <h4 class="mtitle">Lean UX</h4>
                <p>The Lean UX process focuses on reducing wasted time and resources, and producing a workable product as soon as
                  possible. The process is iterative, meaning the team continues to update and make revisions to the product as
                  they gather user research and stakeholder feedback. The Lean UX process is all about staying open to constant
                  feedback and revisions through collaboration. The Lean UX process is broken into three steps:</p>
                <q-img src="../assets/ux/section-01/framework-lean-ux.png"></q-img><br><br>
                <p>These steps are meant to be repeated as many times as needed, until your team reaches the desired final
                  product. The Lean UX process encourages productivity and collaboration. Lean UX teams are typically
                  cross-functional, which means you’ll be working alongside team members like engineers and UX researchers. There
                  are six principles you should keep in mind when using the Lean UX process:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><b>Move forward.</b> Focus only on design elements and features that move the design process toward a
                    particular goal. Don’t get distracted by “nice-to-haves.”</li>
                  <li><b>Stay curious.</b> Lean UX is about using feedback from users and stakeholders to revise and improve your
                    designs. Continuously seek feedback to understand why specific design choices work or don’t work.</li>
                  <li><b>Test ideas in the real world.</b> Lean UX encourages designers to test their ideas - using prototypes,
                    for example - outside of the conference room and with potential users.</li>
                  <li><b>Externalize your ideas.</b> Instead of internally debating and analyzing whether or not an idea is going
                    to work, turn your ideas into something physical, viewable, and testable, while they’re still fresh in your
                    mind. This way, you’ll get feedback on your designs in the early stages, when diverse perspectives and
                    feedback are most helpful.</li>
                  <li><b>Reframe deliverables as outcomes.</b> Focus on creating usable, enjoyable products that users actually
                    want and need. Always keep in mind that you’re designing for your users first-and-foremost, not for the
                    project stakeholders.</li>
                  <li><b>Embrace radical transparency.</b> Feel comfortable being honest with everyone on the team (and expect the
                    same in return), since you will depend on each other’s insights. This way, everyone can make informed
                    decisions about how to move forward and avoid wasting time and energy.</li>

                <h4 class="mtitle">Double diamond</h4>
                <p>Double Diamond is a more traditional UX process, which breaks down UX design into two main phases (or
                  “diamonds”): research and design. Each phase has two steps. When combined, these are the four steps:</p>
                <q-img src="../assets/ux/section-01/framework-double-diamonds.png"></q-img><br><br>
                <p>Like a lot of the design frameworks we’ve discussed, Double Diamond is iterative, not linear. Each sprint leads
                  the team to new insights that are used to improve the product's design. Then, the process starts over again with
                  a new iteration.</p>
                <p>Double Diamond also encourages teamwork across the organization, so the design team doesn’t focus solely on
                  design. To be successful, the entire team must know how to incorporate design principles, design methods, user
                  engagement strategies, and leadership principles. Be prepared to take on multiple roles and responsibilities, as
                  needed. There are four principles that inform the Double Diamond process:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><b>Focus on the user.</b> As is always the case in UX design, the user is the top priority.</li>
                  <li><b>Communicate.</b> Communicate visually, through imagery and design choices that supplement the text. You
                    should also be sure that the communication of your design is equitable and accessible, which you'll learn more
                    about in this part of the program.</li>
