											<q-img src="../assets/ux/section-01/hi.png"></q-img><br /><br />
											<ul>
												<li>Because Googlers created this program, you'll learn the most practical information needed to launch your uwn UXD career.</li>

												<br />
												<li>As the use of technology increases every day, the need for UX designers continues to grow.</li>
												<li>Some UX professionals have taught themselves the skills needed to land their first job (by taking courses, etc).</li>
												<li>UXD is a rapidly changing field with a projected 10-year growth rate of 15% (Burning Glass, 2020).</li>
												<li>Lots of UX jobs don't require a specific work history or a college degree.</li>
												<li>UX designer is one of today’s most in-demand professions.</li>
											</ul>
											<h4 class="mtitle">User experience design (UXD)</h4>
											<p>The phrase "User experience" was first coined in the 1990s by cognitive psychologist, Don Norman. The principles of UX actually stretch back thousands of years, all the way to ancient China, where the practice of Feng Shui began. Practitioners believe that the arrangement of a physical space, like how furniture is positioned in a room, could bring someone luck or improve their health and happiness. Today, lots of different industries still rely on these same basic ideas. In tech world, UX mostly focuses on how people use or interact with products. A product is a good, service, or feature. It might be a physical product (video game controller, bag of photato chips, etc) or a technology product (app, website, smarthwatch, etc).</p>
											<ul>
												<li>UX is all about how a person, the user, feels about interacting with, or experiencing, a product.</li>
												<li>UX designers focus on the experience that users have while using products like websites, apps, and physical objects.</li>
												<li>UX designers make those everyday interactions useful, enjoyable, and accessible.</li>
												<li>UX designers help make technology easier to understand and more enjoyable to use.</li>
												<li>UX designers tend to be curious about people and like thinking about how people's mind work.</li>
											</ul>
											<p>UX designer focus on users. Why is it important that designs are centered on the user? Because the user buys and uses your product. In addition, it's also important to solve problems that people actually experience, rather than only trying to solve problems you personally experience. Focus on the user and all else will follow. Focusing on the user means considering their story, emotions, and the insights you've gathered about them.</p>
											<p>UX designer is important for consumers and businesses. Why? When people like a product, they use that product a lot, and they recommended it to their friends. And more people using the product means better bussiness for the company. Plus, when users have a good experience with the product, they're more likely to have a positive opinion ot the company that made it. A win-win for the user and the business. Can you think of a product you loved so much that you shared it with a friend? If you did, that's a great example of UX design in action. That's why organizations of all kinds, in varied industries, need to hire UX designers. Because UX designer can play in improving the business.</p>
											<hr />
											<br />
											<p>UX designers have a <b>good sense for visuals</b>, but you don't need to know anything about graphic design or draw.</p>
											<ul>
												<li>UX designers focus on how users interact with a product.</li>
												<li>Graphic designers create visuals that tell a story or message.</li>
												<li>Graphic designers focus on the physical appearance of a product, like an invitation or a poster.</li>

											<p>Virtual reality involves a wearable headset that takes over a user’s vision; it blocks out their physical surroundings and immerses them in a completely virtual world. For example, VR can feel like you're entering the setting of a magical imaginary land.</p>
											<p>Augmented reality uses the physical world as a backdrop and adds virtual elements on top of it. Users are still contextually aware of their surroundings, but their reality is augmented, or enhanced, by adding elements through a screen. For example, you can sit in your actual kitchen, and an AR experience can add digital images, like a new barstool or a piece of artwork, to the room around you.</p>
											<p>Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) designers create products that provide users with immersive experiences, unbounded by the limits of the physical world. To ensure users are comfortable immersing in a VR or AR experience, designers need to carefully consider everything from sound to lighting.</p>

											<h4 class="mtitle">Product development life cycle</h4>
											<p>Every new product, whether it’s an app or a physical object, follows a specific set of steps that take it from the first spark of an idea to the release of the final product. This is called the product development life cycle, and it has five stages: brainstorm, define, design, test, and launch. Depending on where you work, the exact names of each stage might be a little different, but the overall process is generally the same. As a product moves through the development life cycle, the team might need to spend longer working in one stage than in others, or repeat certain stages based on feedback. The success of each stage depends on the previous stage’s completion, so it’s important to do them in order.</p>

										<div class="q-px-sm q-pb-sm">
											<h4 class="mtitle">Brainstorm</h4>
											<p><b>An active discovery stage that's all about generating ideas about the user and potential needs or challenges the user might have.</b> During the brainstorm stage, the team generates ideas to solve a problem, understands the audience they're designing for, and identifies needs or challenges the audience may have. Research plays a key role in this stage, because you're exploring different ways to get to know the audience you're designing for. UX researchers and writes are often heavily involved in this stage, where the team might conduct interviews with potential users or conduct other research.</p>
											<hr />
											<br />
											<p>When the team starts thinking of an idea for a product. Your team might already know the user problem that you want to solve when you begin the product development life cycle. If not, coming up with a list of user problems is a great place to start. It’s important to pay attention to the diversity of your team at this stage. Teams that have meaningful diversity across identifiers like race, gender, abilities, family structure, age, and ethnicity are generally more effective at brainstorming because they bring together a lot of different lived experiences.</p>
											<p>The brainstorm stage is also an ideal time to check out your product's competitors and identify if there are already similar products available in the market. You want your product to fill a gap in the market or solve a problem better than existing products. Completing research into both your competitors and your users helps determine what problems need to be addressed by the product’s design.</p>
											<hr />
											<br />
											<p>Consider this example: If you’re designing a new app to help working parents and guardians, your team might start the brainstorming stage by listing common problems that working parents and guardians face, like a lack of reliable childcare, transportation concerns, or trouble managing schedules. Your team might review user feedback about other similar products or the results of user surveys to help guide your ideas. After you’ve brainstormed lots of user problems, your team chooses one and starts coming up with ideas for solutions to that problem.</p>

											<h4 class="mtitle">Define</h4>
											<p><b>Using the insights from the brainstorm stage and starting to narrow the focus.</b> During the define stage, the team determines concrete ways that the product being developed will impact the user. As a UX designer, you'll begin to think more about specific details related to the product:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Who the product is for?</li>
												<li>What the product will do?</li>
												<li>What features need to be included for the product to be successful?</li>
											</ul>
											<hr />
											<br />
											<p>During the define stage, your team narrows the focus of your idea. One product can’t solve every user problem. In this stage, a UX designer might help the team pin down the focus of the idea, but a product lead will probably be the one to define the scope of the project. The research you completed in the brainstorm stage comes in handy now. Using what you've learned, you will pinpoint your potential users’ problems. Your team can’t assume they know what problems users are experiencing without asking the users directly.</p>
											<hr />
											<br />
											<p>Continuing with the example for an app to help working parents and guardians, your idea should focus on helping parents and guardians find reliable childcare or manage their schedules, not both.</p>

											<p><b>Implementing insights into new designs using various tools</b>. UX designers begin to actively develop ideas, and they also check that all specifications from the define stage are realistic. You'll create many different assets, including storyboards, wireframes, and prototype.</p>
											<hr />
											<br />
											<p>At this stage, UX designers develop the ideas for the product. Generally, UX designers start by drawing wireframes, which are outlines or sketches of the product, then move on to creating prototypes, which are early models of a product that convey its functionality. UX writers are also involved in the design stage and might do things like write button labels or other copy within the product's wireframes and prototypes. At this point in the life cycle, UX designers make sure to include all of the product specifications that were outlined in the define stage. You might also check to ensure that each part of the design fits together in an intuitive way.</p>
											<hr />
											<br />
											<p>For example, UX designers might check that the screens of an app flow in a way that makes sense to the user. Or that each interaction, like tapping a button, has a correlating action, like an item getting added to a cart. On the other hand, with a physical product, UX designers might check that one piece of a physical object matches up to the connecting piece. UX designers also make sure that each task a user needs to complete is clear and easy to understand, like navigating from the homepage to the checkout confirmation page in an app.</p>

										<div class="q-px-sm q-pb-sm">
											<h4 class="mtitle">Test</h4>
											<p><b>Evaluating the product design based on the feedback of potential users.</b> Testing designs with users is really important because it helps the team focus on the user first and foremost. Testing helps identify areas to refine or improve the designs.</p>
											<hr />
											<br />
											<p>UX designers work with engineers to develop functional prototypes that match the original designs, including details and features that fit the company’s brand, like font and color choices. This also means writing the code and finalizing the overall structure of the product. Or, if you want to test your designs earlier, another option is to test a functioning prototype of the product, using a design tool like Figma or Adobe XD</p>
											<hr />
											<br />
											<p>At this stage, the designs go through at least three phases of testing: internal tests within your company, reviews with stakeholders, and external tests with potential users. A stakeholder is a person you need to work with to complete the project or anyone who has some interest in the project, either within or outside of the company.</p>
											<ul>
												<li>First, the team tests the product internally to look for technical glitches and usability problems. This is often referred to as <b>alpha testing</b>.</li>
												<li>Then, the product undergoes a test with stakeholders to make sure the product is aligned with the company’s vision, meets legal guidelines for accessibility, and follows government regulations for privacy, for example.</li>
												<li>Finally, there’s an external test with potential users. This is the time to figure out whether the product provides a good user experience, meaning it’s usable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful. This is often referred to as <b>beta testing</b>.</li>
											</ul>
											<p>Gathering and implementing feedback at this stage is absolutely critical. If users are frustrated or confused by your product, UX designers make adjustments or even create new versions of the design. Then, the designs are tested again, until there’s little or no friction between the product and the user. It’s important to call out that the product development life cycle isn’t a completely linear process. Your team might cycle between designing and testing a few times before you're ready to launch the product!</p>

											<p><b>Sharing a finished version of the product with the public.</b> This might involve listing an app in the Google Play Store or Apple’s App Store, making a website go live, or putting a physical product on store shelves. However, the work on a product isn't quite finished after launch. You may still identify opportunities to improve on the designs or learn even more about the UX based on feedback. This could involve going back to the design or testing stages and figuring out ways to produce a more enhanced version of the product.</p>
											<hr />
											<br />
											<p>The launch stage is a time to celebrate your work and start promoting the product. Marketing professionals on your team might post about the new product on social media or publish a press release. The customer support team might get ready to help new users learn how the product works. Program managers also meet with the cross-functional team to reflect on the entsire product development life cycle and ask questions like:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>What worked and what could be improved?</li>
												<li>Were goals achieved?</li>
												<li>Were timelines met?</li>
											</ul>
											<hr />
											<br />
											<p>For a physical product, the launch stage might be the end of the product development life cycle. But for a digital product, like an app or website, launching the product to a wider audience provides another opportunity to improve on the user experience. New users might find problems with the product’s functionality or features to improve that no one noticed before. So, after the launch stage, teams will often cycle back to the design and testing stages to start working on the next version of a digital product.</p>

												<li>Responsibility: Most of the responsibility for a UX project falls solely on you, which can be stressful if you have little UX experience.</li>
												<li>Speed: Have to be comfortable working quickly and launching work that isn’t perfect, with little oversight.</li>

											<h4 class="mtitle">Big companies</h4>
											<p>At a big company, like Google, you’re likely to work in teams on a specific project. Lots of UX designers want to work at big companies with the people who developed some of the most well-known products in the world. UX teams at larger companies tend to be more compartmentalized by specialization, making it easier for you to become an expert in one particular area of UX.</p>
											<p>Advantages:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Mentorship: A variety of experienced designers and other UXers to learn from.</li>
												<li>Growth: Lots of opportunity for growth because there are many levels of designers and management.</li>
												<li>Guidelines: Clearer guidelines to keep products uniform and on brand.</li>
												<li>Team size: More people working on one project, which means you’re better able to focus on your specific responsibilities.</li>
												<li>Specialization: Opportunity to focus on one particular area of design.</li>
											</ul>
											<p>Disadvantages:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Team size: May feel less impactful or important as a contributor with lots of other designers on the project.</li>
												<li>Impact: May feel small at a company with so many features and products.</li>
												<li>Guidelines: Defined guidelines can be restrictive to creativity.</li>

										<div class="q-px-sm q-pb-sm">
											<h4 class="mtitle">Design agencies</h4>
											<p>A design agency is a one-stop-shop for visual brands, products, and services. Working at a design agency can be similar in some ways to working at a small business or startup, except you have multiple companies as your clients. Many agencies tend to work on a broad range of products, so you can explore many kinds of styles and approaches to UX design.</p>
											<p>Advantages:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Impact: Lots of impact on projects, if you’re the only UX designer on the team.</li>
												<li>Networking: Opportunity to work with senior stakeholders, different teams, and diverse clients.</li>
												<li>Exposure: Exposure to lots of companies and industries with different clients.</li>
												<li>Resume: Potential to work with large brands and display that work in your portfolio.</li>
											</ul>
											<p>Disadvantages:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Mentorship: Lack of mentorship if you are the only UX designer on a project.</li>
												<li>Monotony: Depending on the agency, you could work only on the same type of projects.</li>
												<li>Ownership: Might not be able to work on a project from start to finish.</li>
												<li>Finished product: Products you work on might not launch, depending on client priorities.</li>

											<h4 class="mtitle">Advertising agencies</h4>
											<p>A lot of UX designers work at advertising agencies, which are teams of creatives hired by clients to build marketing campaigns. Sometimes called “creative technologists,” these designers work to create ads for brands using UX principles. This is a great option if you’re open to learning some interesting skills outside of a core UX design role.</p>
											<p>Advantages:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Autonomy: Little to no middle management means more autonomy over your work.</li>
												<li>Learning: Opportunity to learn about other disciplines, like branding, marketing, and graphic design.</li>
												<li>Variety: Every project is different based on the client.</li>
												<li>Networking: Work with a bunch of different brands, clients, and teams.</li>
											</ul>
											<p>Disadvantages:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Specialization: Wide variation in projects, so you might not be able to hone in on specific skills easily.</li>
												<li>Relevance: Work may often involve branding and marketing, and might not focus on UX design.</li>

											<h4 class="mtitle">Freelancers</h4>
											<p>Freelancers are self-employed UX designers who are hired by clients for their independent services. Being a freelancer gives you a lot of freedom, and it’s a great way for new UX designers to gain experience in the field and add work to their portfolio.</p>

											<ul>
												<li>Schedule: Set your own hours since you’re self-employed.</li>
												<li>Flexibility: Can freelance while working another job or balancing competing priorities.</li>
												<li>Autonomy: Choose the work that you want to do.</li>
												<li>Experience: Build your portfolio, especially if you don’t have a full-time UX job.</li>
											</ul>
											<p>Disadvantages:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Structure: No one to report to, which means you have to be responsible for getting work done on time.</li>
												<li>Stability: Less stable than working for a company or agency, since work is not always guaranteed.</li>
												<li>Business: Manage the logistics of your own business, such as filing taxes, billing clients, and more.</li>
												<li>Mentorship: Lack of readily available mentors since you’re working by yourself.</li>
